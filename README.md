# ImageToAscii
Console App that converts images into ASCII art. Supports .jpg, .png, .gif, .bmp image types.

Before running the console app, be sure to place images inside of the "images" directory.

If any file type other than .jpg, .png, .gif, or .bmp is placed inside of the images directory, the app will
warn you that you have files that are not of the supported types AND will list the name of each image.

Other than that, the app is pretty easy to use. Have fun!
